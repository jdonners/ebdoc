## Introduction
The numactl program allows you to run your application program on specific cpu's and memory nodes. It does this by supplying a NUMA memory policy to the operating system before running your program. The libnuma library provides convenient ways for you to add NUMA memory policies into your own program. 

numactl is available using the command:

```
module load numactl
```
